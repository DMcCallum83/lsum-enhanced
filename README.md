<strong>lsum-enhanced</strong> (List Summary Enhanced) is a high-performance, visually rich CLI directory analysis tool that transforms standard file listings into actionable intelligence.

### ⚡ TL;DR

`lsum-enhanced` is `ls` on steroids. It doesn't just list files; it **categorizes**, **counts**, and **visualizes** your directory's distribution by MIME types, extensions, and metadata—all while respecting your `.gitignore` rules.

---

### 🤔 Why lsum-enhanced?

Standard tools like `ls` or `tree` are great for finding files, but they fail to answer higher-level questions about your workspace. `lsum-enhanced` was built to fill that gap:

* **Audit Your Assets:** Instantly see how many gigabytes of images vs. text files you have.
* **Visualize Structure:** Group files into elegant, color-coded panels based on their actual content (MIME) rather than just extensions.
* **Clean Analysis:** Use the `--gitignore` flag to strip out `node_modules`, build artifacts, and logs, focusing only on the code that matters.
* **Recursive Intelligence:** Understand the composition of entire project trees in a single, formatted view.

### 🛠️ Usage Examples

#### 1. Basic Listing

A clean, tabular view of your current directory:

```bash
lse
```

#### 2. Group by MIME Type (with Icons)

See your files grouped by their actual content type (e.g., Image, Video, Text):

```bash
lse --group
lse -g
```

#### 3. Respect Gitignore

Exclude build artifacts and ignored files for a "clean" summary:

```bash
lse . --gitignore --count
lse . -gi -c
```

#### 4. Recursive Extension Summary

Analyze every file in your project tree, grouped by extension:

```bash
lse . --recursive --group-extension
lse . -r -ge
```

#### 5. Advanced Sorting & Filtering

Find all `.txt` files and sort them by size:

```bash
lse --filter-extension .txt --sort size
lse -fe .txt -s size
```
